This app populates a chess board with one white and up to sixteen black chess pieces.
It then resolves which black pieces can be hit by the selected white chess piece.
The innitial prompt allows the user to either populate the board randomly, or to determine the position for each piece manually.
All validations are in place to prevent any invalid user input.
